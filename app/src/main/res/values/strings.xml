    <string name="_1_what_is_prima">1. What is “Prima”?</string>
    <string name="what_is_prima_answer">Prima is an android music player that works with tracks, artists and albums on your device.
    It supports a lot of file formats: from .wav to mp3.
        Prima is fully customisable: you can choose language (20 languages), font (near 100) and themes.</string>
    <string name="_3_changing_tracks_info_issues">3. Changing tracks\' info issues</string>
    <string name="changing_tracks_info_answer">Prior to Android 10, Prima can easily change the metadata of tracks.
        In Android 10, the application will request modification permission for each file that you want to change.
        Since Android 11, changing the metadata of tracks has become a big problem, due to the fact that in Android 10 they switched to a different type of storage.
        However, it is possible to change the track parameters in my application, but these changes will only work in my application, because I do not change the metadata itself, but simply replace the data when it is loaded.</string>
    <string name="why_does_the_app_request_permissions">2. Why does Prima requests permissions?</string>
    <string name="permissions_answer">For full functionality, Prima requests the necessary permissions.
        First of all, it asks about reading files on your device.
    Well, it is obvious - app works with music on your device.
    The second one is about phone state.
    It needs to run background service, so you can start listening to the music, switch on another app, but music will continue playing.
    Also service uses headset buttons and their callbacks.
    The last one is about audio recording.
    Prima itself does not record anything - it is used to show beautiful audio visualizer when you listening to the music and that is all.</string>
    <string name="_4_what_is_custom_playlist">4. What is custom playlist?</string>
    <string name="custom_playlist_answer">Custom playlists are playlists created by user.
        They are fully modifiable: you can change their title, add or remove some tracks or even remove them.
    You can not have two or more playlists with the same title - the new one will not be created.</string>
    <string name="about_languages">5. About languages</string>
    <string name="where_language_answer">I have translated Prima only into the most used languages.
        If your language is not among them, you should not be sad - you can write to me (the developer) about it and I will definitely add your language if I will find a translator.
        However, I can not promise that the translation will be correct, even today translators make mistakes.
        Unfortunately, I am not a guru of foreign languages and I speak only English and Russian, so there may be translation inaccuracies in the application.
        If you find an error, let me know about it.</string>
    <string name="what_is_save_progress">6. What is “save progress“?</string>
    <string name="save_progress_answer">Saving progress includes all non-long-term user activity: the current track and playlist, looping and equalizer parameters.</string>
    <string name="_7_what_is_equalizer">6. What is equalizer?</string>
    <string name="what_is_equalizer_answer">To put it simply, the equalizer is a tool that allows you to adjust the sound.
        In my equalizer, you can modify the frequencies, bass, reverb, pitch and speed.
        You can enable it when you started listening for the first time during the session.
        This is due to the fact that the equalizer needs to know which audio session to change.
        After you have started listening to a track for the first time, you can turn it on and off at any time.
        For phones, the equalizer is not supported in a horizontal position due to the fact that it is quite problematic to place it conveniently and its use becomes very difficult on narrow phones.
        This rule does not apply to tablets and other android devices with large screens.
        The equalizer is located at the bottom of the playing panel.
        It has a double pyramid icon.</string>
    <string name="_9_how_to_contact_developer">8. How to contact with the developer?</string>
    <string name="contact_dev_answer">You can contact me via Github, VKontakte or via email.
        To do this, go to “About App” and select the appropriate communication method for you.</string>
    <string name="about_advertisement_question">7. Is there an ad in the app?</string>
    <string name="about_advertisement_answer">No, there are no ads in the app.
        I did not set out to earn money from my users, so you will not find any advertising content in my application.
        For the fact that you use my application, I do not receive a single cent to my account, so I will be very happy if you rate my application on the play market or github.
        Thank you for being here :)</string>
